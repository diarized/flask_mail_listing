# flask_mail_listing
Web reader for e-mails

# Assumptions
This software is dedicated to quite narrow application, where Postfix or any SMTP server push receiving emails trough procmail to users home directories.

In the future it can be more general by adding a separation layer that will provide a translation to different mail sources (disk, database).

This is working, but by now not very functional prototype of mail viewer. No security, no fancy UI.
